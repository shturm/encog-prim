# encog-prim
## Framework for neural network machine learning
### cross-platform, decoupled from Windows assemblies

The original repostiory seems abandoned 6 years ago so I decided to revive it

Differences from original:
* _NUnit_ instead of Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools
* _Cross paltform_ project formats - Xamarin Studio, Visual Studio, Mono Develop, xbuild
* No dependancies on Windows.* - classes using forms are either refactored to use console/GTK UI or deleted
